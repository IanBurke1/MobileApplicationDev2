# Introduction
This repository is for my UWP for the module Mobile Application 2 in the course Computing and Software Development studied at Galway Mayo Institute of Technology (GMIT). Lecturer of the module is Damien Costello.

# UWP (Universal Windows Platform) Soundboard
For my project, I have decided to make a soundboard for my Windows application. The soundboard will consist of sounds from various characters based from a famous Irish television comedy called Father Ted. The user can navigate between characters and choose a sound to play. The user simply can click/tap a button to play a sound. 

# System Requirements
- Windows 10 Operating System
- Windows 10 Mobile
- Integrated Mouse
- Integrated Touch

# Architecture
To develop the mobile app, I used Microsoft's [Visual Studio 2015](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/) as an IDE (integrated development environment). The application is a [UWP](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/get-started/universal-application-platform-guide) (Universal Windows Platform) which was first introduced in Windows 10. The purpose of this software platform is to help develop universal apps that run on both Windows 10 and Windows 10 Mobile without the need to be re-written for each.
